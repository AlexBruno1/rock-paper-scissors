# rock-paper-scissors
A simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.

Edit after finishing the project:

The project was easily implementable and led me to understand and work better with javascript functions. 
In particular used Math library to generate random numbers, later converted in strings:
1 -> rock
2 -> paper
3 -> scissors

also learned how to get user input through Window.prompt().
